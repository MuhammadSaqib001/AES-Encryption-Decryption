This AES.ipynb contains encryption as well as decryption of AES implemented in PYTHON .
Steps to execute this AES Algorithm properly:-
1. Run the AES.ipynb file 
2. The key file k.key and input file input.pt must be located in the same folder as AES.ipynb's . The initial key and plain text is taken from these files .
3. The results of encryptions will be stored in encryption.enc and those of decryptions in encryption.dec .
